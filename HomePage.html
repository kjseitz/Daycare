        <p class="mission">
            The goal in this learning program is to bring up children who will follow Christ, enjoy learning in all things, and are equipped to do whatever God calls them to do. To Create a learning environment that suits the interests of the children and their changing needs. To encourage children's curiosity, imagination, and love of learning. To understand that learning comes in many forms where one way is not the only way. To remember that learning is about the journey, not just the destination.
